										small fraction of their free time.

										With the ever-growing number of mobile phone players
										around the world – expected to top 2,000,000,000 very soon
										and still expanding rapidly – plus the instant

									</p>

										Owning a game that complements your channel and gives your

									We are fully committed to building a fun and successful

									<div class="partners__slide-title">Time commitment</div>

										We’ll do our very best to minimize the time you need to
										put into this project. However, some involvement is still
										necessary to ensure that your game perfectly fits the
										needs and wants of your audience – and that you are 100%
										happy with the end result.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the development phase – which typically takes 4-12
										months, depending on game complexity – you can expect
										bi-montly calls lasting 30 minutes to an hour. Once the
										game is live, the time commitment scales down to 1 short,
										monthly call to touch base and plan special game events.
									</p>
									<p>
										And while it’s essential that our partners continue to
										promote the game once it’s live (especially to highlight
										new features and events), we don’t ask for lengthy pitches
										tacked on each piece of content you produce – just a quick
										reminder every now and then is enough!

									<p>
										This win-win scenario not only generates heightened
										excitement and anticipation for the game's launch,
